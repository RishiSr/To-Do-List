json web token:

used to authenticate the user in browser

what hpappens is that firstly whenuser log in server creaets that JWT wrt the user and save it to cookkies 
then
lets take example that:
suppose that after entering into amazon we see that if we close that tab it then then again revisit amazon it contains the same data 
as before in wishlist etc
it is becoause of cookies stored in browser locally

bts:
when one login in amazon the amazon server provies a jwt token to the user which later browser stores torough cookies 
any req given by the client is merger with the jwt toekn as header to authticate with the browser cookies the it is legit user or not 

we can also delete the cookies then we again have to login
